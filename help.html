                        1. Check that Flash is installed on the computer (click here to download the software). If you have Flash software, 
                        ensure that it is updated. Some browsers have Flash software built in to the browser with no need for installation 
                            (for example, Google Chrome).</p>

                        suitable for viewing video content, network system collapse due to external reasons, the blocking of video content by 
                        the network itself (e.g.in institutions and offices) etc. Please note that when viewing on the computer is based on 
                        a home network, it is recommendedthat you connect your computer directly via the network cable, rather than relying 
                            on the wireless network. However, it is important to note that viewing is possible, of course, without a direct cable.</p>
